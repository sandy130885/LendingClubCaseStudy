## Problem Statement
- Problem statement of the case study is that the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 


## Conclusions
- From the analysis of the loan data set it is found that the people with own houses have less chances of defaulting the loan than the people who live in the rented or mortgaged house.
From the analysis it is clear that the verified applicants have less chances of defaulting than the applicants who are not verified.
From the analysis it is clear that the applicants with good annual income have less chances of defaulting then the applicants who have less annual income.
